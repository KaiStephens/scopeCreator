A good project scope document should include:

1. Project Overview
- Brief description of the project
- Key objectives and goals
- Business value and expected outcomes

2. Deliverables
- Specific, measurable outputs
- Quality criteria
- Acceptance criteria

3. Timeline
- Project phases and milestones
- Key dates and deadlines
- Dependencies

4. Resources
- Team members and roles
- Required tools and technologies
- External dependencies

5. Constraints
- Budget limitations
- Technical constraints
- Time constraints

6. Assumptions and Risks
- Key assumptions made
- Potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Dependencies on external factors

7. Out of Scope
- Explicit listing of what is not included
- Boundaries of the project
- Future considerations

The scope should be:
- Clear and unambiguous
- Measurable and verifiable
- Realistic and achievable
- Aligned with business objectives
- Comprehensive yet concise

Here are some scopes that has been created as example for what the final scope should look like:

## Project Purpose
This scope document defines how the designed and prototyped game screens will function as well as defines the administrative functions required to manage it.

## Requirements
### Game Screen Requirements
#### Game Screen
The game screen will consist of several components: GoPOP!, game board, word prediction control, Clues, chronicle, and HUD (Heads Up Display). The optimal game screen size will be set at 1024x768 pixels and will not change. When viewed on a screen size smaller than 1024x768, components may appear off the screen. When viewed on a screen size larger than 1024x768, components will remain in place, but the header and the footer will still be attached to the top and bottom of the screen respectively and empty space will appear above and below the game board. The game board, GoPOP!, and clues will remain centred on the screen.

#### Game Board
The game board is the area where correctly predicted words show up on the screen. The game board will be 80 characters in width and 12 lines in height. This configuration allows for puzzles containing up to 960 characters (which includes all alpha-numerics, punctuation, and spaces).

On a new game, the game board will initialize with only punctuation in the places it should be. Each character spot will be mono-spaced which will prevent the game board from shuffling/shifting words and punctuation around as words are added to it. As correct words are predicted, they will be added to the game board. If a word exists multiple times on the board, all instances of that word will be added.

#### Word Prediction Control
The word prediction control is an input control that allows the user to enter word predictions. Input can be submitted either by clicking on the "Enter" button or by pressing the return / enter key on the keyboard.

Validation will take place on any input entered. Only single words will be allowed. Case will not be considered, if the word in the puzzle contains an uppercase letter, entering the lowercase letter will still work.

### Administrative Requirements
#### Login
The login system will provide a secure way for users to authenticate themselves. All users will access the system through a login page, which requires an email address (used as the username) and a password. Logins will be performed securely over HTTPS.

The password minimum requirement includes 12 characters with at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one symbol. Passwords will be stored encrypted in the database using a specific industry-standard algorithm (For example, bcrypt).

#### Dashboard
The dashboard will be the first screen the player sees after logging in. Exiting a game session will return the player to the dashboard. Depending on the type of user logged in (super administrator or player), the menu and the body of the dashboard will show different information. A super administrator will have a player dashboard, plus some extra items in the menu.

## Assumptions
1. There is only 1 GoPOP! list of hints used for all puzzles.
2. The designs will be implemented for a screen size of 1024x768 pixels only.
3. Some functionality and layout in both the game and the administration of the web app may require deviation from the existing design to ensure compliance and proper function.
4. User requirements and functions will be subject to change throughout the development process if decisions on targeted users change.
5. The client will set up a Github account and repository and invite Treefrog to perform development within the repository. This will ensure that the ownership of the application resides with Techolinks throughout development.
